### 7. What is the percentage of sales by demographic for each year in the dataset?

```TSQL
WITH sales_cte AS (
  SELECT
    calendar_year,
    CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN demographic='Couples' THEN sales END)AS NUMERIC) AS couple_sales,
    CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN demographic='Families' THEN sales END)AS NUMERIC) AS family_sales,

  FROM clean_weekly_sales
  GROUP BY 1)
 
SELECT calendar_year,
       ROUND((couple_sales/(couple_sales+family_sales+unknown_sales))*100,2) couple_percentage,
       ROUND((family_sales/(couple_sales+family_sales+unknown_sales))*100,2) family_percentage,
       ROUND((unknown_sales/(couple_sales+family_sales+unknown_sales))*100,2) unknown_percentage

### 9. Can we use the `avg_transaction` column to find the average transaction size for each year for Retail vs Shopify? If not - how would you calculate it instead?

```TSQL
SELECT
    calendar_year,
    ROUND(CAST(AVG(CASE WHEN platform='Retail' THEN sales END)AS NUMERIC),2) AS avg_retail_sales,
    ROUND(CAST(AVG(CASE WHEN platform='Shopify' THEN sales END)AS NUMERIC),2) AS avg_shopify_sales
  FROM clean_weekly_sales
  GROUP BY 1
  ORDER BY 1;
```

| calendar_year | avg_retail_sales | avg_shopify_sales |
|---------------|------------------|-------------------|
| 2018          | 4415676.23       | 100707.08         |
