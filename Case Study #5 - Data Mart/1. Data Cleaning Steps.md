# 🛒 Case Study #5 - Data Mart
### ⚠️ Disclaimer

Some of the queries and Python codes might return different results. I ensured they were at least very similar and answered the question.    
All the tables shown are actually the table markdown I made for my repository [8_Week_SQL_Challenge](https://github.com/KannaKit/8_Week_SQL_Challenge), therefore my Python codes might show slightly different table if you try to run. 

### Import packages

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
```

### Reading in Files

Read files from the [case study](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-5/).  
If you need guidance on reading files, I recommend watching this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUpyC40cF6Q&list=PLUaB-1hjhk8FE_XZ87vPPSfHqb6OcM0cF&index=53) I used to learn from. Shout out to [Alex the Analyst](https://www.youtube.com/@AlexTheAnalyst)👏

## 🧹 1. Data Cleaning Steps

In a single query, perform the following operations and generate a new table in the `data_mart` schema named `clean_weekly_sales`:

* Convert the `week_date` to a `DATE` format
* Add a `week_number` as the second column for each `week_date` value, for example any value from the 1st of January to 7th of January will be 1, 8th to 14th will be 2 etc
* Add a `month_number` with the calendar month for each `week_date` value as the 3rd column
* Add a `calendar_year` column as the 4th column containing either 2018, 2019 or 2020 values
* Add a new column called `age_band` after the original `segment` column using the following mapping on the number inside the `segment` value

| segment | age_band |
|----------------|----------------|
| 1              | Young Adults             |
| 2              | Middle Aged             |
| 3 or 4              | Retirees             |

* Add a new `demographic` column using the following mapping for the first letter in the `segment` values:

| segment | demographic |
|----------------|----------------|
| C              | Couples             |
| F              | Families             |

* Ensure all `null` string values with an `"unknown"` string value in the original `segment` column as well as the new `age_band` and `demographic` columns
* Generate a new `avg_transaction` column as the `sales` value divided by `transactions` rounded to 2 decimal places for each record

`weekly_sales` -> `w_sales` 

```python

df['week_number'] = df['week_date'].dt.week

# Add a month_number column
df['month_number'] = df['week_date'].dt.month

# Add a calendar_year column
df['calendar_year'] = df['week_date'].dt.year

# Add an age_band column
df['age_band'] = np.where(df['segment'].isna(), 'unknown',

                    np.where(df['segment'].str.startswith('F'), 'Families', 'Couples'))

# generate avg_transaction
df['avg_transaction'] = (df.sales/df.transactions).round(2)

w_sales_c = df[['week_date', 'week_number', 'month_number', 'calendar_year', 'region', 'platform', 'segment', 'age_band', 'demographic', 'customer_type', 'transactions', 'avg_transaction', 'sales']]
