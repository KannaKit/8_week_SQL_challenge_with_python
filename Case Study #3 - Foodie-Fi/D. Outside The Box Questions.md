# ðŸ¥‘ Case Study #3 - Foodie-Fi
## ðŸ“¤ D. Outside The Box Questions
### 1. How would you calculate the rate of growth for Foodie-Fi?
###### SQL

```TSQL
WITH monthlyRevenue AS (
  SELECT 
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM payment_date) AS months,
    SUM(amount) AS revenue
  FROM payments
  GROUP BY months
)

SELECT 
  months,
  revenue,
  (revenue-LAG(revenue) OVER(ORDER BY months))/revenue AS revenue_growth
FROM monthlyRevenue;
```

###### Python

```python
df=payments

df['payment_date'] = pd.to_datetime(df.payment_date)

df['month_of_date'] = df['payment_date'].dt.month

monthly_revenue = df.groupby('month_of_date')['amount'].sum().reset_index(name='revenue')

monthly_revenue['lag_revenue'] = monthly_revenue.sort_values('month_of_date', ascending=True)['revenue'].shift(1)

monthly_revenue['growth'] = (monthly_revenue.revenue-monthly_revenue.lag_revenue)/monthly_revenue.revenue

result_df = monthly_revenue[['month_of_date', 'revenue', 'growth']]

result_df
```

First 4 rows.

| months | revenue | revenue_growth         |
|--------|---------|------------------------|
| 1      | 1272.10 | null                   |
| 2      | 2762.80 | 0.53956131460836832199 |
| 3      | 4173.70 | 0.33804537939957351990 |
| 4      | 5744.60 | 0.27345681161438568395 |
