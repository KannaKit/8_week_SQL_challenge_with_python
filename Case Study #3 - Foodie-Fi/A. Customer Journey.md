# ü•ë Case Study #3 - Foodie-Fi
### ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

Some of the queries and Python codes might return different results. I ensured they were at least very similar and answered the question.    
All the tables shown are actually the table markdown I made for my repository [8_Week_SQL_Challenge](https://github.com/KannaKit/8_Week_SQL_Challenge), therefore my Python codes might show slightly different table if you try to run. 

### Import packages

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

### Reading in Files

Read files from the [case study](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-3/).  
If you need guidance on reading files, I recommend watching this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUpyC40cF6Q&list=PLUaB-1hjhk8FE_XZ87vPPSfHqb6OcM0cF&index=53) I used to learn from. Shout out to [Alex the Analyst](https://www.youtube.com/@AlexTheAnalyst)üëè

## üö∂ A. Customer Journey

Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from the `subscriptions` table, write a brief description about each customer‚Äôs onboarding journey.

Try to keep it as short as possible - you may also want to run some sort of join to make your explanations a bit easier!

###### SQL

```TSQL
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS sample;
CREATE TEMP TABLE sample AS (
  SELECT *
  FROM subscriptions
  WHERE customer_id IN (1,2,11,13,15,16,18,19)
);

SELECT customer_id, plan_name, start_date, price
FROM sample t1
JOIN plans t2 ON t1.plan_id = t2.plan_id
ORDER BY customer_id, t1.plan_id;
```

###### Python

```python
sample_customer = [1,2,11,13,15,16,18,19]

df=subscriptions.merge(plans, how='inner')

sample_customer = df[df['customer_id'].isin(sample_customer)].sort_values('customer_id', ascending=True)

sample_customer
```

First 5 rows.
