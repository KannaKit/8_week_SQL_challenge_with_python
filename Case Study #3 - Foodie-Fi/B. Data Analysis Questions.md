# ü•ë Case Study #3 - Foodie-Fi
## ‚ùì B. Data Analysis Questions
### 1. How many customers has Foodie-Fi ever had?
###### SQL

```TSQL
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id)
FROM subscriptions;
```

###### Python

```python
subscriptions.customer_id.nunique()
```

| count | 
|-------------|
| 1000	           | 

---

### 2. What is the monthly distribution of `trial` plan `start_date` values for our dataset - use the start of the month as the group by value
###### SQL

```TSQL
SELECT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM start_date) month_by_month, COUNT(customer_id) n_of_customers
FROM subscriptions
WHERE plan_id=0
GROUP BY month_by_month
ORDER BY n_of_customers DESC;
```

###### Python

```python
# change data type for order_time to datetime
subscriptions['start_date'] = pd.to_datetime(subscriptions.start_date)

df=subscriptions[subscriptions['plan_id']==0]

# extract month from date
df['month_of_date'] = df['start_date'].dt.month

monthly = df.groupby('month_of_date')['customer_id'].count().sort_values(ascending=False).reset_index(name='customer_count')

monthly
```

First 5 rows.

| month_by_month | n_of_customers |
|----------------|----------------|
| 3              | 94             |
| 7              | 89             |
| 5              | 88             |
| 1              | 88             |
| 8              | 88             |

###### Python Plot

```python
monthly_plot = monthly.sort_values('month_of_date', ascending=True)

monthly_plot.plot(kind='bar', x='month_of_date', y='customer_count')

# add an average line
plt.axhline(y=np.nanmean(monthly_plot.customer_count))
```

### 3. What plan `start_date` values occur after the year 2020 for our dataset? Show the breakdown by count of events for each `plan_name`
###### SQL

```TSQL
SELECT plan_name, COUNT(t1.plan_id) count_event
FROM subscriptions t1
JOIN plans t2 ON t1.plan_id = t2.plan_id
WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM start_date) > 2020
GROUP BY plan_name
ORDER BY count_event DESC;
```

###### Python

```python
theDate = '2021-01-01 00:00:00'

# create a dataframe contains only data after year 2020
year21 = subscriptions[subscriptions['start_date']>=theDate] 

# merge with plans table
year21 = year21.merge(plans, how='inner')

year21 = year21.groupby('plan_name')['plan_name'].count().sort_values(ascending=False).reset_index(name='customer_count')

year21
```

| plan_name     | count_event |
|---------------|-------------|
| churn         | 	71          |
| pro annual    | 	63          |
| pro monthly   | 	60          |
| basic monthly | 	8           |

###### Python Plot

```python
year21.plot(kind='bar', x='plan_name', y='customer_count', title='The Breakdown of Plans in 2021')
```

FROM cte;
```

###### Python

```python
churn = subscriptions[subscriptions['plan_id']==4]

churn_n = churn['customer_id'].nunique()

                   (~trial_to_churn['plan_rank']==1)])
```

```python
trial_to_churn = len(trial_to_churn[(trial_to_churn['plan_id']==4) & (trial_to_churn['plan_rank']==2)])

trial_to_churn_perc = ((trial_to_churn/total_customer_n)*100.0)

data = {
    'trial_to_churn': [trial_to_churn],
    'trial_to_churn_perc': [trial_to_churn_perc]

 FROM subscriptions s
 JOIN plans p ON s.plan_id=p.plan_id
 )
 
 SELECT plan_name, COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) n_customer, ROUND((CAST(COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS NUMERIC)/(SELECT CAST(COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id)AS NUMERIC) FROM subscriptions))*100,1) percentage
 FROM ranking
 WHERE plan_rank=2
 GROUP BY plan_name
 ORDER BY n_customer DESC;
```

###### Python

```python
after_trial = subscriptions

after_trial['plan_order']=after_trial.groupby('customer_id')['start_date'].rank(method='first').astype(int)

after_trial = after_trial[after_trial['plan_order']==2].merge(plans, how='inner')

FROM subscriptions
),

num_customer AS(
 SELECT plan_id,
        COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id)AS number_customer
 FROM date_plan
 WHERE (next_date IS NOT NULL AND ('2020-12-31'::DATE > start_date AND '2020-12-31'::DATE < next_date))

```

###### Python

```python
df = subscriptions

df['next_date'] = df.sort_values('start_date', ascending=True).groupby('customer_id')['start_date'].shift(-1)

filtered_df = df[((~df['next_date'].isna()) & (df['start_date'] < '2020-12-31') & (df['next_date'] > '2020-12-31')) | (df['next_date'].isna()) & (df['start_date'] < '2020-12-31')]

grouped_df = filtered_df.groupby('plan_id')['customer_id'].count().reset_index(name='customer_n')

grouped_df['percentage'] = grouped_df.customer_n*100/total_customer_n

### 8. How many customers have upgraded to an annual plan in 2020?
###### SQL

```TSQL
WITH cte AS(
   SELECT customer_id, plan_id, EXTRACT(YEAR FROM start_date::timestamp) yr
   FROM subscriptions
)
 
 SELECT COUNT(customer_id) n_customer
 FROM cte
 WHERE plan_id=3 AND yr='2020';
```

###### Python

```python
df20 = subscriptions[subscriptions['start_date']<='2020-12-31']

df20_annual = df20[df20['plan_id']==3]

df20_annual['customer_id'].count()
```

| n_customer | 
|---------|
| 195      |

### 9. How many days on average does it take for a customer to an annual plan from the day they join Foodie-Fi?
###### SQL

```TSQL
 WITH start AS (
 SELECT customer_id, 
        MIN(start_date) day1
 FROM subscriptions
 GROUP BY customer_id
 ),
 
 upgrade_annual AS (
 SELECT customer_id, 
        start_date day_upgrade
 FROM subscriptions
 WHERE plan_id=3)
 
 SELECT ROUND(AVG(day_upgrade-day1),0) avg_days_to_upgrade
 FROM start s
 JOIN upgrade_annual u ON s.customer_id=u.customer_id;
```

###### Python

```python
# determine which customer joined annual plan
annual_id = subscriptions[subscriptions['plan_id']==3]

# make it to list
annual_id = annual_id.customer_id.to_list()

# filter subscriptions table using the list 
df = subscriptions[subscriptions['customer_id'].isin(annual_id)]

# create a column to store the day the customer started the annual plan
df['day_annual']=df[df['plan_id']==3]['start_date']

# copy a table
df_day1 = df

# store customer_id and start_date of their first plan
df_day1=df_day1[df_day1['plan_order']==1][['customer_id', 'start_date']]

# change a column name to 'day1'
df_day1=df_day1.rename(columns={'start_date':'day1'})

# merge two tables
df = df.merge(df_day1, how='left', on='customer_id')

# keep rows only with annual plan rows
df = df[df['plan_id']==3]

# create a new column to day_annual subtract by day_1 to determine how many days it took for customers to change to the annual plan
df['days_to_annual']=df.day_annual-df.day1

# calculate the average
df.days_to_annual.mean()
```

| avg_days_to_upgrade | 
|---------|
| 105      | 

###### Python Plot

```python
plot_df = df

# create a new column to get rid of 'days' from 'days_to_annual' column
plot_df['days_to_annual2'] = pd.to_timedelta(plot_df.days_to_annual, errors='coerce').dt.days

# create a distribution plot using seaborn
sns.displot(df, x="days_to_annual2").set(title='Days to Switch to Annual Plan from Joining Day', xlabel='days')
```

### 10. Can you further breakdown this average value into 30 day periods (i.e. 0‚Äì30 days, 31‚Äì60 days etc)
###### SQL

```TSQL
 --determine day 1 for each customer
 WITH start AS (
 SELECT customer_id, 
        MIN(start_date) day1
 FROM subscriptions
 GROUP BY customer_id
 ),
 
 --determine the day the customer upgraded to annual plan
 upgrade_annual AS (
 SELECT customer_id, 
        start_date day_upgrade
 FROM subscriptions
 WHERE plan_id=3),
 
 -- Sort values above in buckets of 12 with range of 30 days each
 bins AS (
  SELECT WIDTH_BUCKET(day_upgrade-day1, 0, 360, 12) AS day_bin
  FROM start s
  JOIN upgrade_annual u ON s.customer_id=u.customer_id) 
 
SELECT ((day_bin-1)*30 || ' - ' || (day_bin)*30) || ' days' AS breakdown,
       COUNT(*) AS customers
FROM bins
GROUP BY day_bin
ORDER BY day_bin;
```

###### Python

```python
day_bin = np.floor_divide(df.days_to_annual2, 30)
day_bin = np.clip(day_bin,0,12)

day_bin = day_bin.reset_index()

day_bin = day_bin.groupby('days_to_annual2')['days_to_annual2'].count().reset_index(name='customer_n')

day_bin=day_bin.rename(columns={'days_to_annual2':'breakdown'})

# Convert day_bin to a numpy array
day_bin_array = day_bin.values.flatten()

# Define the bin edges and labels
bin_edges = np.arange(0, 361, 30)
bin_labels = [(bin_edges[i], bin_edges[i+1]) for i in range(len(bin_edges)-1)]
bin_labels = [f"{start} - {end} days" for start, end in bin_labels]

day_bin['breakdown'] = bin_labels

day_bin
```

First 5 rows.

| breakdown      | customers |
|----------------|-----------|
| 0 - 30 days    | 48        |
| 30 - 60 days   | 25        |
| 60 - 90 days   | 33        |
| 90 - 120 days  | 35        |
| 120 - 150 days | 43        |
