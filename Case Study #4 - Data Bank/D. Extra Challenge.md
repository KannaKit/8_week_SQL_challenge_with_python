# üè¶ Case Study #4 - Data Bank
## üí™ D. Extra Challenge

Data Bank wants to try another option which is a bit more difficult to implement - they want to calculate data growth using an interest calculation, just like in a traditional savings account you might have with a bank.

If the annual interest rate is set at 6% and the Data Bank team wants to reward its customers by increasing their data allocation based off the interest calculated on a daily basis at the end of each day, how much data would be required for this option on a monthly basis?

Special notes:

* Data Bank wants an initial calculation which does not allow for compounding interest, however they may also be interested in a daily compounding interest calculation so you can try to perform this calculation if you have the stamina!

```TSQL
--using the table created for challenge C
WITH cte AS (SELECT *, LAG(txn_date) OVER(PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY txn_date) previous_txn
             FROM impact_tbl),

        (CASE WHEN previous_txn is null THEN 1
         ELSE txn_date-previous_txn END) days_n
  FROM cte),
  
--calculate the daily interest rate, since the annual rate is 6% the daily rate will be 0.06/365
--if the balance is negative then no interest
--if it's the customer's first day using data bank then the customer gets (0.06/365)% interest
--if the customer kept their balance positive for 30 days then the customer will get 30*(0.06/365)% interest

```

###### Python

```python
df = result

df['prev_txn'] = df.sort_values(['customer_id', 'txn_date'], ascending=True).groupby('customer_id')['txn_date'].shift(1)

df['day_n'] = np.where(df.prev_txn.isna(), 1, (df.txn_date-df.prev_txn).dt.days).astype(int)

daily_interest = 0.06/365

df['interest']=np.where(df.impact>0, df.day_n*daily_interest, 0)

df['balance_w_interest'] = (df.impact+df.interest)

result=df[['customer_id', 'txn_date', 'txn_type', 'txn_amount', 'txn_order', 'impact', 'balance_w_interest']]

result.sort_values(['customer_id', 'txn_date'], ascending=True)
```
