# 💪 8-Week SQL Challenge by Python 💪

This repository contains my solution for the [#8WeekSQLChallenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/) using Python.

### ⚠️ Disclaimer

Some of the queries and Python codes might return different results. I ensured they were at least very similar and answered the question.    
All the tables shown are actually the table markdown I made for my repository [8_Week_SQL_Challenge](https://github.com/KannaKit/8_Week_SQL_Challenge), therefore my Python codes might show slightly different table if you try to run.

Danny seriously loves Japanese food so in the beginning of 2021, he decides to embark upon a risky venture and opens up a cute little restaurant that sells his 3 favourite foods: sushi, curry and ramen.

Danny was scrolling through his Instagram feed when something really caught his eye - “80s Retro Styling and Pizza Is The Future!”

Danny was sold on the idea, but he knew that pizza alone was not going to help him get seed funding to expand his new Pizza Empire - so he had one more genius idea to combine with it - he was going to Uberize it - and so Pizza Runner was launched!

Danny started by recruiting “runners” to deliver fresh pizza from Pizza Runner Headquarters (otherwise known as Danny’s house) and also maxed out his credit card to pay freelance developers to build a mobile app to accept orders from customers.
