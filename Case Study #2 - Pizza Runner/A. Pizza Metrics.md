FROM customer_orders1;
```

count	| 
 --- |
14 |	

---

### 2. How many unique customer orders were made?

```TSQL
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM customer_orders1;
```

count	| 
 --- |
10 |

### 3. How many successful orders were delivered by each runner?

```TSQL
SELECT runner_id, COUNT(order_id) AS successful_delivery
FROM runner_orders1
WHERE cancellation IS NULL
GROUP BY runner_id
ORDER BY runner_id;
```

| runner_id | successful_delivery |
|-----------|---------------------|
| 1         | 4                   |

### 4. How many successful orders were delivered by each runner?

```TSQL
SELECT pizza_id, COUNT(pizza_id)
FROM customer_orders1 c
JOIN runner_orders1 r ON c.order_id = r.order_id
WHERE cancellation IS NULL
