# üçï Case Study #2 - Pizza Runner
### ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

Some of the queries and Python codes might return different results. I ensured they were at least very similar and answered the question.    
All the tables shown are actually the table markdown I made for my repository [8_Week_SQL_Challenge](https://github.com/KannaKit/8_Week_SQL_Challenge), therefore my Python codes might show slightly different table if you try to run. 

### Import packages

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

### Reading in Files

Read files from the [case study](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-2/).  
If you need guidance on reading files, I recommend watching this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUpyC40cF6Q&list=PLUaB-1hjhk8FE_XZ87vPPSfHqb6OcM0cF&index=53) I used to learn from. Shout out to [Alex the Analyst](https://www.youtube.com/@AlexTheAnalyst)üëè

## üìè A. Pizza Metrics
### 1. How many pizzas were ordered?
###### SQL

```TSQL
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM customer_orders1;
```

###### Python

```python
c_o.order_id.count()
```

count	| 
 --- |
14 |	

---

### 2. How many unique customer orders were made?
###### SQL

```TSQL
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT order_id)
FROM customer_orders1;
```

###### Python

```python
# count unique order_id
c_o.order_id.nunique()
```

count	| 
 --- |
10 |	

---

### 3. How many successful orders were delivered by each runner?
###### SQL

```TSQL
SELECT runner_id, COUNT(order_id) AS successful_delivery
FROM runner_orders1
WHERE cancellation IS NULL
GROUP BY runner_id
ORDER BY runner_id;
```

###### Python

```python
success_orders = r_o

# filter out cancelled orders 
success_orders = success_orders[success_orders['cancellation'].isna()]

# count order_id by each runner
success_orders = success_orders.groupby('runner_id')['order_id'].count()

success_orders
```

| runner_id | successful_delivery |
|-----------|---------------------|
| 1         | 4                   |
| 2         | 3                   |
| 3         | 1                   |

###### Python Plot

```python
success_orders.plot(kind = 'bar', title = 'Successful Orders By Each Runner')
```

### 4. How many of each type of pizza was delivered?
###### SQL

```TSQL
SELECT pizza_name, COUNT(pizza_id)
FROM customer_orders1 c
JOIN runner_orders1 r ON c.order_id = r.order_id
JOIN pizza_names pn ON c.pizza_id = pn.pizza_id
WHERE cancellation IS NULL
GROUP BY pizza_id;
```

###### Python

```python
# join r_o, c_o and pizza_names
r_c_n = c_o.merge(r_o, how='left')
r_c_n = r_c_n.merge(pizza_names, how='left')

# count n of pizza which were successfully delivered
type_pizza = r_c_n[r_c_n['cancellation'].isna()].groupby('pizza_name')['order_id'].count()

type_pizza
```

| pizza_name | count |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Meatlovers         | 9                   |
| Vegetarian         | 3                   |

###### Python Plot

```python
type_pizza.plot(kind = 'bar', title = 'A Breakdown of Pizza Types Delivered')
```

###### SQL

```TSQL
SELECT customer_id, n.pizza_name, COUNT(c.pizza_id) AS total_count
FROM customer_orders1 c
JOIN pizza_names n ON c.pizza_id = n.pizza_id
GROUP BY customer_id, n.pizza_name
ORDER BY customer_id;
```

###### Python

```python
veg_meat =  r_c_n.groupby(['customer_id', 'pizza_name'])['order_id'].count()

veg_meat
```


| customer_id | pizza_name | total_count |
|-------------|------------|-------------|
| 101         | Meatlovers | 2           |
| 101         | Vegetarian | 1           |

### 6. What was the maximum number of pizzas delivered in a single order?
###### SQL

```TSQL
SELECT c.order_id, COUNT(pizza_id) AS total_delivered
FROM customer_orders1 c
JOIN runner_orders1 r ON c.order_id = r.order_id
WHERE cancellation IS NULL
GROUP BY c.order_id
ORDER BY totalDelivered DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

###### Python

```python
max_pizza = r_c_n[r_c_n['cancellation'].isna()].groupby(['order_id'])['pizza_id'].count()

# creating dataframe using DataFrame constructor
df_max = pd.DataFrame(max_pizza)
 
# max on pizza count
print(df_max.max())
```

| order_id | total_delivered | 
|-------------|------------|
| 4         | 3 |

### 7. For each customer, how many delivered pizzas had at least 1 change, and how many had no changes?
###### SQL

```TSQL

       SUM(CASE WHEN (exclusions IS NOT NULL) OR (extras IS NOT NULL) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Atleast1change,

FROM customer_orders1 c
INNER JOIN runner_orders1 r ON c.order_id = r.order_id
WHERE cancellation IS NULL
GROUP BY c.customer_id
ORDER BY c.customer_id;
```

###### Python

```python
s_orders = r_c_n

s_orders = s_orders[s_orders['cancellation'].isna()]

s_orders['change'] = np.where((s_orders['exclusions'].notnull()) | (s_orders['extras'].notnull()), +1, +0)
s_orders['no_change'] = np.where((s_orders['exclusions'].isna()) & (s_orders['extras'].isna()), +1, +0)

s_orders = s_orders.groupby(['customer_id']).sum()

# reset index
s_orders.reset_index(inplace=True)

# select relevant columns
s_orders[['customer_id', 'change', 'no_change']]
```

| customer_id | Atleast1change | NoChange |
|-------------|------------|-------------|
| 101         | 0 | 2           |
