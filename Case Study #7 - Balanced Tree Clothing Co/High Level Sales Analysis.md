# üåÑ Case Study #7 - Balanced Tree Clothing Co.
### ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

Some of the queries and Python codes might return different results. I ensured they were at least very similar and answered the question.    
All the tables shown are actually the table markdown I made for my repository [8_Week_SQL_Challenge](https://github.com/KannaKit/8_Week_SQL_Challenge), therefore my Python codes might show slightly different table if you try to run. 

### Import packages

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import itertools
```
